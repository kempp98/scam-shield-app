# Scam Alert: 3 Real Fraud Victims Share How They Lost Thousands

Scams are getting smarter, sneakier, and more personal. In the last five years, U.S. consumers have been hit hard by everything from text phishing scams to crypto fraud and fake government agents. In 2022 alone, Americans lost over $330 million to scam text messages. In 2023, losses from crypto romance scams topped $3.9 billion [1, 2].

Below are three true stories of Americans who were scammed out of thousands of dollars. These victims spoke up to warn others and show how easily anyone can fall for a well-crafted scam.

## 1. Text Phishing Scam: $3,000 Gone in 3 Days

**Victim:** Shanna Coulter, Fort Worth, TX  
**Scam Type:** Bank impersonation via text + Zelle fraud

Shanna received a text from her credit union asking if she authorized a $2,000 Zelle payment. She replied "No." Moments later, her phone rang. Caller ID said it was her bank. A man claiming to be a fraud agent said he’d help cancel the payment. 

The "agent" asked for a verification code texted to her. In her panic, Shanna read it aloud, not realizing she was giving the scammer access to her Zelle account [3]. Over three days, the scammer drained $3,000 by posing as a helpful bank rep and repeatedly asking for new codes [4].

Her bank initially refused to reimburse her since the transfers were technically authorized, but after persistence, she got her money back [4].

**Red Flags:**
- Unsolicited text about suspicious activity
- Urgent call from a spoofed number
- Request for a one-time code

**Lesson:** Never give verification codes to someone who contacts you. Contact your bank using a verified number instead.

## 2. Pig Butchering Scam: A Widow Loses Nearly $1M

**Victim:** Erika DeMask, Lombard, IL  
**Scam Type:** Romance-investment crypto scam

Erika, 62, met a man online who sent flowers and professed his love. Over weeks, he gained her trust and began asking for financial help. First, it was $35,000 for a broken oil rig. Then another $35,000. Eventually, he convinced her to invest in a fake opportunity, promising to double her money if she matched $250,000 [5].

Erika drained savings, retirement accounts, and took a home equity loan. In total, she lost nearly **$1 million**. When she ran out of money, she finally realized it was a scam. The FBI and Secret Service could not recover her losses, as the scammer was likely overseas [5].

**Red Flags:**
- Refusal to meet in person
- Emergency financial requests
- Pressure to invest fast with high returns

**Lesson:** Never send money or invest with someone you haven’t met in person. Romance and financial pitches rarely mix well.

## 3. Government Impersonation Scam: $165,000 Mailed Away

**Victim:** Leslie Fumega, 78, Connecticut  
**Scam Type:** FBI impersonation phone scam

Leslie got repeated calls from what appeared to be her local police department. The caller claimed to be the chief and transferred her to a supposed FBI agent who said criminals stole her identity. To protect her money, she was told to withdraw cash and mail it to secure locations.

Over six weeks, she mailed **$165,000** hidden in notebooks and bubble wrap. She kept the scam a secret, believing she was helping a government investigation. When she told her daughters, they called police and ended the scam [6].

**Red Flags:**
- Caller claimed to be from law enforcement
- Urged secrecy and isolation
- Demanded cash shipments to protect money

**Lesson:** No real government agency will ask you to mail money or keep an investigation secret. Hang up and verify with the agency directly.

## How to Protect Yourself from Scams

These real-life scam stories share common tactics: urgency, emotional pressure, and impersonation. Here are five quick fraud prevention tips:

- **Don’t trust caller ID.** Scammers spoof numbers to look legitimate.
- **Never share verification codes.** No real company will ask for them.
- **Don’t send money to people you haven’t met.** Especially if they ask for crypto, wire transfers, or gift cards.
- **Verify all urgent claims.** Hang up and call back on a verified number.
- **Talk to someone you trust.** Scammers want you isolated. A second opinion can save you.

If you’ve been scammed, report it right away to [ReportFraud.ftc.gov](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov) and [IC3.gov](https://www.ic3.gov).
