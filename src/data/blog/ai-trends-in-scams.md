# The Evolving Role of AI in Scams

Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing how scammers operate. AI refers to smart computer programs that can mimic human tasks, like speaking or writing. Unfortunately, criminals are using these tools to trick people. They can clone voices, create fake videos, and write realistic scam messages. This makes their scams more convincing than ever before. Below, we explain how scammers use AI, with real examples, and how you can spot these tricks.

## AI Voice Cloning Scams

AI can copy someone’s voice from just a few seconds of audio. Scammers use this to pretend to be someone you know. For example, in 2023 an Arizona mother got a terrifying phone call from what sounded exactly like her 15-year-old daughter crying and saying she’d been kidnapped. A man demanded ransom money. It felt very real—but it was all fake, created with AI voice cloning technology.

In fact, it takes only 3 seconds of audio to clone someone’s voice, and most people can't tell the difference. Always be cautious if you receive an urgent, emotional call—it could be an AI-generated imposter.

## Deepfake Videos and AI Impersonation

Scammers also use AI to create deepfake videos. These videos swap faces or change someone’s speech, making it look like they're saying things they never did. Elon Musk, the famous billionaire, has been used in deepfake scams where fake videos showed him promoting investments in a fake crypto program. One victim sent over $10,000 believing the scam was real because it looked and sounded exactly like Musk.

Deepfakes aren't just used for celebrities. In early 2024, scammers impersonated a company executive in Hong Kong using a deepfake video call. They convinced an employee to transfer around $25 million.

## AI-Generated Messages and Phishing Scams

AI can also quickly create convincing written messages, like scam emails and texts. Studies show phishing emails written by AI can fool people almost as often as those written by humans. After the release of ChatGPT, an AI chatbot, phishing emails increased by over 1,200%. These messages look professional, making it harder to spot scams.

## How to Protect Yourself

Here are quick tips to stay safe:
- **Verify urgent calls**: Hang up and call the person back on a number you trust.
- **Double-check videos**: Be cautious if a celebrity promotes easy ways to make money online. Check trusted news sources before believing it.
- **Beware of messages that pressure you**: Scammers use urgency so you don't have time to think. Slow down and carefully check messages asking for money or personal details.

## Conclusion

AI-powered scams are becoming smarter and harder to detect. Knowing how scammers use AI helps you stay safe. Stay calm, stay cautious, and you can avoid becoming a victim of AI scams.
